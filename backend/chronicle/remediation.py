"""Deterministic remediation steps for Chronicle explanations.

PRD FR-13 permits Chronicle to "suggest deterministic remediation steps". The
operative word is *deterministic*: the remediation text must not be authored
by the language model, or a judge-facing incident report could carry an
invented instruction (NFR-3, TNFR-4).

Before this module existed, `suggested_remediation` was grounded against a
`remediation` key inside each event's `detail` dict — but nothing in the
system ever writes such a key, so the grounded set was always empty. Live
explanations therefore always returned `[]`, and any remediation the model did
offer was rejected as ungrounded, silently sending the whole explanation to
the fallback path. Only the fallback's two hardcoded cases ever produced a
remedy.

Remediation is now a pure lookup keyed by the `reason` a module actually
recorded, which is the same identifier the block itself was decided on. The
model never writes these strings; it is told not to try.

Adding a new `reason` anywhere in the backend means adding it here too —
`test_remediation.py` fails if a reason the system can emit has no entry.
